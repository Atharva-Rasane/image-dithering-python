# image-dithering-python
multiple python implementations for image dithering

image dithering - wikipedia definition:
Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing large-scale patterns such as color banding in images. Dither is routinely used in processing of both digital audio and video data.
